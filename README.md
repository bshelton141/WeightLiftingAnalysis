# WeightLiftingAnalysis
Final Project for the JHU Data Science Machine Learning MOOC.

This project analyzes 159 different predictor variables in order to project one of 5 categories of a bicep curl.

The dataset can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

This respository's R markdown file contains an outline and code of the analysis I performed.
This analysis includes: 
-data partition into testing and training variables
-visual analysis
-several pre-processing steps (k-nearest neighbors, near-zero variance, and PCA)
-model creation and application to a test set
